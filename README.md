# VR Maze
Able to build and run to Oculus Quest 2

## Goal
Navigate the Maze, find the key, open the door, and get to the red carpet to win.

## Work Done and Tools Used
Free SciFi Warehouse Kit asset + ProBuilder + ProGrids to build a maze.
XR Interaction Toolkit
Teleportation area overlayed on floor for locomotion
XR Plug-in management plus Oculus plug-in to build on Meta Quest 2


## Roadblocks and Struggles
It was difficult for me to grasp the Interaction Layers and Masks that exist in the XR Environment and how those differ from the Object Layer.
I also struggled to gather how to migrate from raycast interactions vs grab interactions for actions like picking up the key to open the door.
